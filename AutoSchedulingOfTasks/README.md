# Time Management Assistant Tool

## Overview
Designed a command-line tool to generate daily schedules based on user-defined working hours, task durations, and deadlines. Users can manually add tasks or load them from a file with auto-scheduling for efficient time allocation.

## Creative Inspiration
In my daily studies, I often have numerous assignments, tests, previews, and reviews to manage. Without a proper schedule, everything can become messy and overwhelming. To address this, I want to build a assistant tool that helps me efficiently plan my assignments and study schedule.

When faced with a large workload, I would like this tool to automatically generate a schedule based on the assignment details and test dates I provide. The input information can include the assignment name, estimated time or hours needed to complete it, and its due date. Additionally, I can input exam dates along with their difficulty levelâ€”easy exams are automatically scheduled for one hour of review, average exams for two hours, and difficult exams for three hours.

The scheduler will automatically distribute assignments across different days based on the daily working hours I define. Exam reviews will be scheduled on the day before the exam date to ensure proper preparation.

As a user, I only need to enter the tasks that need to be completed, and the program will handle the scheduling for me. This system eliminates the need to manually plan and ensures that everything is organized efficiently, automatically generating a plan for completing my tasks.

## Key Features
1. Built on Linux using GCC, GDB, and Makefile for streamlined builds.
2. Leveraged data structures (e.g., BST, hash tables, stacks, and linked lists) for optimized task management and improved time complexity.

## How Data Structures Be Used

### Goal and Data Structure Selection

The program's goal is to **optimize time complexity**. The main requirements include:
- **Sorting tasks by date** to list all current tasks.
- **Searching for task details** by name.
- **Searching for tasks on a specific date.**
- **Inserting new tasks** and **deleting completed tasks.**
- **Generating a schedule** based on tasks.

To meet these requirements efficiently, the following **data structures** are used:

### **1: Hash Table + Linked List**
- **Purpose:**  
  Used for **searching task details by name** and **retrieving tasks by date**, as well as for insertion and deletion.
- **Why Hash Table:**  
  - Provides **O(1)** time complexity for insertions and lookups using **key-value pairs**.
  - Inefficient for sorting, so a **BST** is used for that purpose.
- **Collision Handling:**  
  - **Separate Chaining:** Uses **linked lists** to store multiple tasks that hash to the same index.

### **2: BST + Recursion (Default Option)**  
- **Purpose:**  
  Used to **sort tasks by date** and **list them in ascending order of due dates**.
- **Why Recursion:**  
  - Provides straightforward and **readable code** for **in-order traversal**.
  - Suitable for trees of moderate depth where stack overflow is unlikely.

#### **2.1: Iterative + Manual Stack (Optional Alternative):**
- **Purpose:**  
  An alternative to recursion for **in-order traversal** in cases where the tree depth is very large.
- **Advantages:**
  - **Prevents stack overflow** for deep trees.
  - Offers better control over the traversal process.
- **Trade-offs:**
  - May increase code complexity compared to recursion.
  - Avoids the overhead of recursive function calls in specific cases.

### **3: Array + Linked List**
- **Purpose:**  
  Implements the **scheduler**, where tasks and exams are organized by day.
- **Structure:**
  - **Array:** Represents up to 31 days in a month for **O(1)** access to specific days.
  - **Linked List:** Dynamically stores tasks for each day, supporting varying workloads.
- **Benefits:**  
  - Combines **efficient access** with **dynamic task storage.**
  - Ensures **flexible scheduling** and task retrieval while maintaining daily work limits.

This structure ensures the program achieves **optimal time complexity** while addressing the specific requirements efficiently.

## Program vulnerable to what happens
1. If the time are inserted in order, it will become linkedlist, the insertion time will become less efficient, so I can choose to use more efficient tree, such as AVL, red balck
2. Validation is flawed, exam + review can continue to progress, automatically generated deadlines will lead to late.
3. Input of documents may be incorrect due to punctuationl Still need a better validation.
